DragDrop is a simple script I wrote to assist in uploading files to an
FTP server using Python. To set it up simply clone the repo, customize
the config.txt (you can do this using flags as well).
If you are on Windows I suggest making a shortcut to DragDrop/dist/dragdrop.exe
so you can easily drag and drop the desired file to upload onto the shortcut.
I haven't tested it in *nix as of yet, but I would imagine it would work the same
in terms of creating the shortcut/launcher.

If you would prefer to run it from the console/command line, simply run 
dragdrop.exe "<file to upload>" if you want to use the config.txt settings, or you can overide those settings using flags 
Ex: dragdrop.exe -directory=foo/bar
